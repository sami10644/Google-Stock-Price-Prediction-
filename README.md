# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction-
this is done by me . I used rnn model . I prefer lstm(long short term memory) version of rnn beacuse of its long term memory handling capability .
from 2012-2016 all the google stock price data are being used . Its been a great pleasure as you are reading this . Hope you would like to see my other work .
